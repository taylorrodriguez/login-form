# login-form
## About
This is a simple login form with user authentification. Instead of using a database I stored the entries into a local variable, so this is not meant for production purposes. Passwords are protected using bcrypt module, to mirror real world encyption practices. The theme is "save the orangutan" and was inspired by my love for the animal and concern for their lives and diminishing habitats.

## Usage
Starting from the register page, enter your name, email, and create a password. Then on the login page, login with the required data. You will then have access to the main page, where you would otherise have no way of accessing without registering first.
