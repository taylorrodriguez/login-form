          Many orangutans are killed as a result of human-orangutan conflicts.
          The adult orangutans are hunted and shot in the forest or killed when
          they enter plantation areas. The infant orangutans are captured and
          kept as pets or sold on the illegal market for wildlife trade. Save
          the Orangutan works to rescue, rehabilitate, and reintroduce the
          displaced and orphaned orangutans to their natural habitats.

          The orangutans' last natural habitats are disappearing at an alarming
          rate. The rainforest is being cleared and destroyed for the benefit of
          palm oil plantations and mining, and large forested areas are being
          destroyed as a result of logging and forest fires. The remaining
          forests must be conserved. The forest areas that have been destroyed
          or cleared must be restored if the orangutan species is to survive in
          the wild
